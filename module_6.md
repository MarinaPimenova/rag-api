# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives
- Understand what is Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Learn how to use embeddings with RAG

## ðŸ“‘ Task

### Goal
You need to implement a simple application that uses RAG approach to generate text based on <br/>the knowledge source.
There are not any restrictions on the approach to application development.
You can write a console or web application, you can use any database, etc...
You can use functions or just retrieve knowledge in the method and add it as a context in query that you are sending to the model.

There are two requirements for the application.:
- Application should have ability to upload new information and use it as a knowledge source.
- Application should have ability to generate text based on the knowledge sources.


#### Evaluation Criteria
1. Text Generation Based on Knowledge Sources
- Implemented the ability to generate text based on the uploaded knowledge sources
- Verified that the generated text is relevant and accurate based on the knowledge sources

## API Endpoints

Method | Endpoint | Description <br/>
POST | /api/ask | Ask a question to the AI <br/>
POST | /api/upload | Upload new knowledge context <br/>

## Application uploads new information and use it as a knowledge source.
